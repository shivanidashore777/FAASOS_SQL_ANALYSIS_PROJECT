# FASSOS_SQL_ANALYSIS_PROJECT

Faasos is a popular food delivery company that operates primarily in India. Founded in 2011, Faasos started as a quick-service restaurant chain offering a variety of wraps and other fast-food items. Over time, it transitioned into an online food delivery platform, catering to the increasing demand for convenient food options.

Faasos gained prominence by introducing a unique concept of "wraps on wheels" and rapidly expanded its menu to include a diverse range of Indian and international cuisines. The company focused on providing tasty and affordable meals with efficient delivery services.

In addition to its own kitchens and delivery fleet, Faasos also collaborated with local restaurants to offer a wider selection of dishes. It utilized technology to streamline the ordering process, allowing customers to conveniently place their orders through a user-friendly mobile app or website.

Faasos experienced significant growth and secured funding from various investors, enabling it to expand its operations across multiple cities in India. It later rebranded itself as Rebel Foods to reflect its broader vision of becoming a global cloud kitchen network.

Today, Rebel Foods operates numerous brands, including Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Mandarin Oak, among others. These brands cater to different culinary preferences, offering a variety of cuisines and food options to customers. Rebel Foods has revolutionized the food delivery industry in India, leveraging technology, innovation, and a vast network of cloud kitchens to provide a seamless and enjoyable dining experience for its customers
